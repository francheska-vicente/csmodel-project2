    "Considering this, it can be reasonably concluded that out of the three types of data mining techniques discussed, this is a **collaborative filtering dataset**. To rule out the other options, an association rule mining dataset should have different sets of items and a clustering dataset usually has floating-point values. All things considered, the biggest indication that points to this dataset being a collaborative filtering dataset is the limitation of the values that appear in the dataset. Collaborative filtering datasets revolve around analyzing user ratings for items, movies, and the like; ratings that are usually quantified as set values, such as on a scale of 1 to 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we would be utilizing an item-item collaborative filtering data mining technique which would mean that we would be focusing on the similarity between each item. Compared to user-user collaborative filters, item-item collaborative filters are more widely used. This is due to the fact that user-based collaborative filters suffer from several issues (e.g. the number of people that rate items is low, new users have little to no information, more users means greater cost in finding the nearest K neighbors); these issues\n",

Every iteration, we would pass it to the `get_cosine_similarity` function declared in our `CollaborativeFiltering` class. In this function, we made us of the [`isinstance`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) function, [`sum`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sum.html) function, [`sqrt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.sqrt.html) function, and lastly, the [`square`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.square.html) function."
